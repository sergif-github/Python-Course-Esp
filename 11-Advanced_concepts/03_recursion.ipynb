    "## Part 3: Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. It is an alternative to iterative (loop-based) solutions and can be particularly useful for solving problems that exhibit a recursive structure. In this section, we will explore recursion and understand its principles and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Principles of recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion follows the principle of solving a problem by reducing it to a simpler version of the same problem. It involves two essential components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base Case: A condition that determines when the recursion should stop. It represents the simplest form of the problem that can be directly solved.\n",
    "- Recursive Case: The portion of the problem that can be broken down into smaller subproblems. The function calls itself with modified input to solve these subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Typical recursion problems \n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is commonly used to solve a variety of problems in programming. Some typical recursion problems include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factorial**: The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n",
    "- **Binary Search**: A divide and conquer algorithm for searching elements in a sorted array.\n",
    "- **Tower of Hanoi**: A puzzle that involves moving disks from one peg to another using three pegs.\n",
    "- **Depth-First Search**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "- **Merge Sort**: A sorting algorithm that divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.\n",
    "- **Permutations and Combinations**: Problems involving generating all possible arrangements or selections of elements.\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: A general algorithmic technique for finding solutions by trying all possible options and undoing incorrect choices."

Recursion can be applied to a wide range of problems and provides an elegant and concise solution in many cases. However, it requires careful consideration of termination conditions and can potentially lead to stack overflow if not implemented correctly. With an understanding of recursion, you can tackle complex problems and develop efficient algorithms in your Python programs."
