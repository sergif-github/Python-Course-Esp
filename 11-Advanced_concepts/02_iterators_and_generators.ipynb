    "In Python, iterators and generators are essential concepts that provide a convenient and memory-efficient way to work with sequences of data. They allow you to iterate over a collection or generate values on the fly without loading all the data into memory at once. In this section, we will explore iterators and generators and understand their usage and benefits.\n",
