    "## Part 3: Loop control statements (break, continue)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use loop control statements to alter the normal flow of execution within loops. Two commonly used loop control statements are break and continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Break statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The break statement is used to exit the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated, and the program execution continues with the next statement after the loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:"

    "In this example, the break statement is used to exit the loop when the value of num is equal to 3. As soon as the condition is met, the loop is terminated, and the program execution continues with the statement after the loop. In this case, only the numbers 1 and 2 will be printed before the loop is exited.\n",

The break statement allows you to exit the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met, while the continue statement allows you to skip the current iteration and proceed with the next iteration. Use these statements judiciously to control the flow of your loops based on specific conditions."
