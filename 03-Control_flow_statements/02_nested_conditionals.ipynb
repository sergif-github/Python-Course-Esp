    "In this example, the outer if statement checks if num is greater than 0. If the condition is true, it prints \"Number is positive.\" Then, there is a nested if-else statement inside the first code block. It checks if num is divisible by 2 to determine if it's even or odd.\n",

    "In this part, you learned about nested conditionals in Python. Nested conditionals allow you to place conditional statements inside other conditional statements, enabling you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on those conditions. Make sure to properly indent the code blocks to indicate the hierarchy of the conditionals and maintain readability."
