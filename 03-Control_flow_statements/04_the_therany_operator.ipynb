    "In this example, the ternary operator is used to assign a value to the variable result based on the condition num > 0. If the condition is True, the value \"Positive\" is assigned to result; otherwise, the value \"Non-positive\" is assigned. The value of result is then printed, which will be either \"Positive\" or \"Non-positive\" depending on the value of num.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ternary operator can be used to simplify the code and make it more readable in cases where you need to assign a value based on a simple condition. However, it's important to use it judiciously and avoid nesting multiple ternary operators, as it can make the code less understandable.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you learned about the ternary operator in Python. The ternary operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional statements and assign a value based on a condition. It can make the code more readable and compact in certain situations. However, it's important to use it sparingly and avoid excessive nesting to maintain code clarity."
