    "## Part 3: Raising exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can raise exceptions explicitly to indicate that an error or exceptional condition has occurred during the execution\n",
    "of your code. This can be useful when you want to handle specific situations or enforce certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Raising exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise an exception, you use the raise statement followed by an instance of an exception class or an exception object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to raise a ValueError exception with a custom error message, you can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised, the program flow is interrupted, and the raised exception is propagated up the call stack until \n",
    "it is caught by an appropriate except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates raising a custom exception:"

    "\n",
    "Inside the try block, we prompt the user to enter a positive number, and then call the check_positive function to validate it. If the number fails the validation, a ValueError is raised, and the corresponding except block handles the exception by printing the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates a concise way to raise a custom exception based on a specific condition. It ensures that the entered number meets the required criteria, and if not, it provides a clear error message to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Custom exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to built-in exceptions, you can also create your own custom exception classes to represent specific types of \n",
    "errors or exceptional conditions in your code. Custom exceptions can provide more meaningful error messages and allow you to \n",
    "handle specific situations with greater control.\n",
    "\n",
