    "# Module 8: Modules, packages and libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Creating and organizing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, packages provide a way to organize related modules together. A package is simply a directory that contains one \n",
    "or more modules and an additional __init__.py file. In this section, we will explore how to create and organize packages effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Creating a package\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a package, you need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a directory with a suitable name for your package.\n",
    "2. Inside the package directory, create an __init__.py file. This file can be empty or can contain initialization code for the package.\n",
    "3. Create one or more Python modules inside the package directory. These modules will contain the code specific to your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example package structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_package/\n",
    "    init.py\n",
    "        module1.py\n",
    "        module2.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Importing modules from a package\n",
    "\n",
    "To import modules from a package, you can use the import statement followed by the package name and module name. For example,\n",
    "to import module1 from the my_package package, you can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_package.module1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once imported, you can access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module by prefixing them with the module name. \n",
    "For example, to use a function my_function() from module1, you would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_package.module1.my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the from keyword to import specific items from a module within the package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from my_package.module1 import my_function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this import statement, you can directly use my_function() without prefixing it with the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Organizing subpackages\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages can also have subpackages, which are essentially nested packages within a package. To create a subpackage, follow the same \n",
    "steps as creating a package, but place the subpackage directory inside the parent package directory. The subpackage will also require its own __init__.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example package structure with a subpackage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_package/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    module1.py\n",
    "    subpackage/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        module3.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To import modules from a subpackage, you can use dot notation to specify the package and subpackage names. For example, to import \n",
    "module3 from the subpackage, you can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_package.subpackage.module3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages provide a way to organize related modules together in Python. To create a package, you need to create a directory with an\n",
    "__init__.py file and one or more modules inside the package directory. You can import modules from a package using the package \n",
    "and module names, and you can organize subpackages within a package for further organization. Understanding how to create \n",
    "and organize packages will help you structure your code and make it more manageable and reusable."
