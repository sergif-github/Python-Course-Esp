    "# Module 8: Modules, packages and libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Introduction to modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a module is a file containing Python code that defines functions, classes, and variables. Modules provide a way\n",
    "to organize and reuse code, making it easier to manage large programs and collaborate with others. By importing modules, \n",
    "you can access the functionality defined within them and leverage their capabilities in your own code.\n",
    "On the other hand, a package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy and a library is a collection of modules or packages that provide pre-written code and functionality to accomplish specific tasks or solve common problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Using modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module in your Python program, you need to import it first. Python provides several ways to import modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importing the entire module\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can import the entire module using the import statement followed by the module name. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import math\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Once imported, you can access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module using the module name as a prefix. For example, to access the sqrt() function from the math module, you would write math.sqrt().\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importing specific items\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you only need specific functions, classes, or variables from a module, you can import them directly using the from keyword. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from math import sqrt, pi\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  With this import statement, you can directly use sqrt() and pi in your code without the need to prefix them with the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importing with an alias\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can also import a module or specific items with an alias using the as keyword. This can be \n",
    "useful to provide shorter or more meaningful names. \n",
    "\n",
    "  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import math as m\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  With this import statement, you can use m.sqrt() instead of math.sqrt().\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Standard library modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries can be part of the Python standard library, which is included with Python itself, or third-party libraries created by other developers.\n",
    "Python comes with a rich set of standard libraries that provide a wide range of functionality for various tasks. \n",
    "These modules are included with Python and can be readily used without the need for additional installation. They provide a wide range of functionalities, making it easier for developers to perform common tasks without having to build everything from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most commonly used standard library modules include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- random:\n",
    "\n",
    "  This module provides functions for generating random numbers, selecting random items from a sequence, and shuffling sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "  The datetime module allows for manipulation and formatting of dates and times. It provides classes for working with dates, times, timezones, and intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- os\n",
    "\n",
    "  The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system. It allows you to perform various operating system-related tasks, such as working with files and directories, managing processes, and accessing environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- csv\n",
    "\n",
    "  The csv module provides functionality for reading and writing CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. It allows you to easily handle tabular data in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- math\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Provides mathematical functions and constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- json\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Offers functions for working with JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples, and there are many more standard library modules available for various purposes, including network programming (socket), regular expressions (re), data serialization (pickle), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the full list of available standard library modules and their functionalities, you can refer to the official Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Third party modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the standard library modules, Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party modules that can be installed and \n",
    "used in your projects. Third-party modules are created by the Python community and offer additional functionality for specific \n",
    "purposes such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Some popular third-party modules include numpy, \n",
    "pandas, matplotlib, and requests. These modules can be installed using package managers like pip or conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are an essential part of Python programming, allowing you to organize and reuse code. By importing modules, you can \n",
    "access functions, classes, and variables defined in them, making it easier to leverage existing functionality and build more \n",
    "powerful applications. Python provides various ways to import modules, allowing you to import the entire module, specific items, \n",
    "or assign aliases. Additionally, Python offers a rich set of standard library modules and a vast collection of third-party modules\n",
    "to extend the capabilities of your programs."
