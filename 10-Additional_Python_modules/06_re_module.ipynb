    "\n",
    "The re module in Python provides support for regular expressions, which are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. Regular expressions allow you to search, extract, and manipulate text based on specific patterns, making them invaluable for tasks such as data validation, text parsing, and string manipulation. Let's explore the key features of the re module.\n",

    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They provide a flexible and concise way to match and manipulate strings based on specific patterns. Regular expressions use a combination of ordinary characters and special characters called metacharacters to define patterns."
