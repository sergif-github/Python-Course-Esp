    "# Module 10: Additional Python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 10: Milestone project, online store management\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an advanced online store management system. The system should allow the user to manage products, perform sales transactions, and generate reports. Additionally, different types of products, such as electronics, books, and clothing, should be supported, each with their own specific attributes and behaviors. The system should utilize object-oriented programming, modules like random and math, loops, and other relevant concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to do your own program or fill the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- Create a base class called Product that represents a generic product in the online store. \n",
    "    - This class should have common attributes like product ID (random), name, price, and quantity. \n",
    "    - Implement methods for updating quantity, calculating total price, and displaying product details. \n",
    "- Create derived classes for different types of products, such as Electronics, Book, and Clothing. \n",
    "    - Each derived class should inherit from the Product class.\n",
    "    - Each derived class should have additional attributes specific to that type of product (Electronics -> brand, Book -> author, and Clothing -> size).\n",
    "    - Overriding the display product details method from the base class allowing to also print the additional attributes for each derived Product class.\n",
    "- Allow the user to manage products by:\n",
    "    - Create product to add new products\n",
    "    - Update product quantities using updating quantity method from the product class.\n",
    "    - Display product information using display product details method from the product class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Additional Features (optional):\n",
    "- Implement a sales feature that allows the user to select previous added products and specify quantities to buy.\n",
    "- Keep track of the total sales made and implement a sales report feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations:\n",
    "- Use the math module to perform calculations, such as rounding prices.\n",
    "- Design the class structure and attributes carefully to represent products considering different product types.\n",
    "- Utilize object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a modular and extensible system.\n",
    "- Break down the project into smaller methods or functions to improve code organization and readability.\n",
    "- Test the program with various scenarios to ensure correct behavior and handle edge cases."
