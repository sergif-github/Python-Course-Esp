    "\n",
    "The Pillow module (PIL) is a popular image processing library in Python. It provides a wide range of functions and methods for opening, manipulating, and saving different image file formats. The Pillow module is widely used in applications that involve image processing, computer vision, and graphics. Let's explore the key features of the Pillow module.\n",

    "### 4.1. Introduction to the pillow module\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pillow module is a powerful image processing library that builds upon the original PIL (Python Imaging Library). It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various image-related tasks, such as opening, resizing, cropping, applying filters, and saving images in different formats. The Pillow module supports a wide range of image file formats, making it versatile for working with different types of images."

We resize the image to a width of 400 pixels and a height of 300 pixels using the resize() method, which returns a new resized image stored in the resized_image variable. We crop a region of the image defined by the coordinates (100, 100, 300, 200) using the crop() method, resulting in a new cropped image stored in the cropped_image variable. We also rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise using the rotate() method, producing a new rotated image stored in the rotated_image variable.
