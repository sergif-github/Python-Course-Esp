    "Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. When multiple operators are used in the same expression, the operator with higher precedence is evaluated first.\n",

    "### 6.1. Operator precedence\n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows a specific set of rules to determine operator precedence. Here are some key points to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.\n",
    "- Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and specify the order of evaluation.\n",
    "- Operators of the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a general overview of the operator precedence in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parentheses: ()\n",
    "2. Exponentiation: **\n",
    "3. Positive/Negative sign: +x, -x\n",
    "4. Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulo: *, /, //, %\n",
    "5. Addition and Subtraction: +, -\n",
    "6. Bitwise Shifts: <<, >>\n",
    "7. Bitwise AND: &\n",
    "8. Bitwise OR: |\n",
    "9. Bitwise XOR: ^\n",
    "10. Comparison Operators: <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=\n",
    "11. Logical NOT: not\n",
    "12. Logical AND: and\n",
    "13. Logical OR: or\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when in doubt about the order of evaluation, using parentheses is always a good practice to ensure the desired outcome.\n",

    "In the first example, without parentheses, the multiplication is evaluated first, resulting in 10 + 6 = 16. In the second example, the parentheses force the addition to be evaluated first, resulting in (10 + 2) * 3 = 36.\n",

Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and specify the order of evaluation. Remember to use parentheses when in doubt to ensure the desired outcome."
