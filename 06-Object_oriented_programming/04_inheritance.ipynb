    "We explored the concept of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Inheritance allows us to create child classes that inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes, promoting code reuse and extending functionality. We learned about single inheritance, where a child class inherits from a single parent class, multiple inheritance, where a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, and multi-level inheritance, where a child class inherits from another child class. Understanding inheritance is essential for building modular, extensible, and efficient code structures."
