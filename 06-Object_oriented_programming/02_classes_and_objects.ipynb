    "### 2.5. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We delved into the fundamental concepts of defining classes and creating objects in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We learned that classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) into a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored how to define classes in Python and create instances (objects) of those classes. We also examined the distinction between class attributes, which are shared among all instances, and instance attributes, which are specific to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we explored accessing object attributes and methods using the dot notation. Through examples like circles, dogs, and rectangles, we saw how objects can possess both attributes and methods, allowing us to represent real-world entities and define their behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding classes and objects is foundational to OOP. It enables us to organize and structure code effectively, encapsulate related data and behaviors, and create reusable and modular components. This section serves as a stepping stone for further exploration into more advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance and polymorphism, which we will cover in subsequent sections."
