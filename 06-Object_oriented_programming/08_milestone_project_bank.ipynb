    "# Module 6: Object oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 9: Milestone project, bank account\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "Create a program that simulates a basic bank account management system using object-oriented programming principles. The program should allow the user to create multiple bank accounts, perform transactions such as deposits and withdrawals, and display the account details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a BankAccount class that represents a bank account. The class should have attributes such as account number, account holder name, and balance.\n",
    "- Implement methods in the BankAccount class to perform transactions, such as depositing and withdrawing funds.\n",
    "- Implement display account detail method, including the account number, account holder name, and current balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Features (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow the user to create multiple bank accounts and perform transactions on each account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design the class structure and attributes carefully to ensure logical representation of bank accounts.\n",
    "- Utilize object-oriented principles.\n",
    "- Break down the project into smaller methods or functions to improve code organization and readability.\n",
    "- Test the program with various scenarios to ensure correct behavior and handle edge cases."
