    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) together within a class. It allows for information hiding, ensuring that the internal state of an object is not directly accessible from outside the class. Encapsulation promotes data integrity, security, and code maintainability."

    "Abstraction is a concept closely related to encapsulation. It involves presenting only essential information to the outside world while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction allows us to focus on the essential features and behaviors of an object, without exposing the underlying implementation.\n",

    "In Python, abstraction can be achieved by defining abstract classes and interfaces using the abc module. Abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes and cannot be instantiated themselves. They can contain abstract methods, which are methods without implementation, meant to be overridden by subclasses."
