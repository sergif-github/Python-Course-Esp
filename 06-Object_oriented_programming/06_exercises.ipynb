    "Create a shape hierarchy consisting of a base class called Shape and two child classes called Rectangle and Circle. The Shape class should have an abstract method calculate_area() which should be overridden by the child classes. The Rectangle class should have attributes for length and width, while the Circle class should have an attribute for radius. Implement the necessary methods and demonstrate polymorphism by calculating the areas of a rectangle and a circle."
