    "Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as results. This powerful concept is supported in Python due to functions being treated as first-class objects. In this section, we will explore the characteristics and benefits of higher-order functions and how they can enhance code flexibility and modularity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions can accept other functions as arguments. This allows for the encapsulation of behavior that can be customized or parameterized by the caller. By passing functions as arguments, the higher-order function can invoke or use these functions internally to perform specific operations or transformations."

    "Higher-order functions provide a powerful way to manipulate and work with functions in Python. They enhance code flexibility and modularity by allowing behavior to be encapsulated, customized, and composed. Understanding higher-order functions empowers you to write more expressive and reusable code, enabling advanced programming techniques and functional programming paradigms."
