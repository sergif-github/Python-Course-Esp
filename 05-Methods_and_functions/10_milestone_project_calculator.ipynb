    "### Project: Simple calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will provide hands-on experience with user input, basic arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops and functions in Python. It will also give you an opportunity to practice structuring a program and writing clean code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "Create a program that simulates a simple calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- The program should display a menu with available operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exit).\n",
    "- The user should be able to choose an operation by entering the corresponding number or symbol.\n",
    "- If the user selects an invalid operation or provides incorrect input, appropriate error messages should be displayed.\n",
    "- After selecting the operation, the program should prompt the user to enter two numbers.\n",
    "- The program should perform the selected operation on the given numbers and display the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Features (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow the user to continue performing calculations without exiting the program after each operation.\n",
    "- Include exponentiation as additional operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break down the project into smaller functions or methods to improve code organization and readability.\n",
    "- Use appropriate data types for calculations and handle edge cases gracefully.\n",
    "- Test the calculator with various input scenarios to ensure accurate results."
