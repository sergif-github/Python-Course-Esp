    "## Part 5: Error handling with files\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, it's important to handle potential errors that may occur during file operations. Errors can arise when \n",
    "a file is not found, permissions are insufficient, or the file is already open by another process. Python provides mechanisms \n",
    "to handle these errors and ensure your program gracefully handles any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1. Handling file-related errors\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle file-related errors, you can use a try-except block. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception,\n",
    "while the except block handles the exception if one occurs.\n",
