    "due to backward compatibility concerns, the adoption of Python 3 was initially slow. This resulted in a period where both \n",
    "Python 2 and Python 3 were widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encourage the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, a deprecation timeline was established. \n",
    "Python 2 reached its end of life (EOL) on January 1, 2020, and is no longer actively maintained or updated. \n",
    "Python 3, on the other hand, continues to receive updates, improvements, and new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For new projects, it is recommended to use Python 3 to take advantage of its improved features, bug fixes, and the larger\n",
    "ecosystem of libraries and tools that support Python 3. However, for legacy projects or systems still dependent on Python 2,\n",
    "there are tools available, such as 2to3, that can assist in migrating code to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 offers numerous benefits and enhancements over Python 2, making it the preferred version for new development.\n",
